* Curly-quotes

Curly-quotes is a simple utility that converts \'straight\' \"quotes\" to
typographically pleasing ‘curly’ “quotes”.

** Installation

You will need GHC to compile this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Text is read from standard input, and the same text is written to
standard output, but with straight quotes converted to curly quotes.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ cat example
"It'll never work," she said.

What's this 'emergency balloon' for?
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ curly-quotes < example
“It’ll never work,” she said.

What’s this ‘emergency balloon’ for?
#+END_SRC

** Bugs and notes

The program's ability to infer the correct character is not perfect.
In particular, an apostrophe at the start of a word contraction will
be erroneously converted to an opening quote; for example =fish 'n'
chips= becomes =fish ‘n’ chips= (incorrect) instead of =fish ’n’
chips= (correct).
